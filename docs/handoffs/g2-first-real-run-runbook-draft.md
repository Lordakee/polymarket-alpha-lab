# First scoped real-run operator runbook — DRAFT (operative only after owner authorization)

Worker N1 of the post-L9 cycle (§66 all-native-subagent flow), 2026-10-09.
Updated by worker N5 (D-2: activation-record pinning with T8 evidence) on
2026-10-10: the Step 0 gate table now carries a Status column (T8 and D-1
SATISFIED per DELIVERY_PLAN.md §68:3111-3125 at e76361d7; D-3 provisionally
set; D-4 unchanged and still held), and Step A records the executed T8
outcome. The runbook REMAINS A DRAFT: nothing below is operative until the
owner's explicit final authorization.
Companion decision package: [g2-activation-readiness.md](g2-activation-readiness.md)
(the §65 prerequisite mapping, the PINNED-WITH-AVAILABLE-EVIDENCE activation
record, and decision requests D-1..D-4).

**Status: DRAFT. This runbook is NOT operative.** Nothing in it may be
executed against a real provider endpoint, a real credential, or a live
project database until the owner explicitly authorizes the scoped real run
(decision chain in Step 0). Until then `activation_authorized=false`, real
provider calls remain false, and every step below is a described shape, not
a command to run now. Phase 1 boundaries are absolute: paper-only /
report-only / readonly; no live trading, no account or private-key handling,
no order paths; PostgreSQL-only persistence through the single audited
`validate_local_postgres_dsn` gate (Project Iron Rule 1).

**Credential boundary (plan N1 acceptance):** this runbook contains zero
credential material and stops at the reviewed supply procedure's boundary —
it names WHERE the operator's private local channel sits and what the
supplier contract requires, and nothing more. No key value, no channel
implementation, no discovery.

Evidence discipline (plan Revision 1 F3): every command shape below is
derived from LANDED DELIVERY_PLAN.md sections and repository files — at
`67cad027969f34bc21dfad64bb4fcb1b7e72b2d9e` (tree
`3cdb1e846c26b706b778970e0c5dbb1f8640a95f`) for the N1 authoring, extended
at `e76361d79a3e066ec20aa05b6245bbe406157007` for the N5 update (§68:
3111-3139, including the T8 evidence recorded against the execution
tree/commit `2e5cd30a70f81374c4302ba08592e1495337873b`, 2e5cd30a), with
file:line provenance in §9. W12/W15 environment facts (the 154 PG18
prefix, the transferred L8-B fixture) remain re-verify instructions only —
no step's correctness rests on them; the T8 image's npm-channel
re-acquisition is recorded evidence (§68:3116-3118), and any local copy is
still re-measured before use.

## 0. Authorization preconditions (the gate order — each step's entry ticket)

This runbook becomes operative only when ALL of the following hold, in
order. Steps A and B are pre-activation engineering/approval steps (Step A
is now COMPLETE — see its status); Steps C-G are the real-run arc itself.

| Order | Gate | Owning decision / evidence | Blocks | Status (2026-10-10, §68 at e76361d7) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | D-1 resolved (154 dedicated/non-shared attestation, or an alternative qualified host named) | Owner attestation or §66 arbitration ruling; facts on record in DELIVERY_PLAN.md §68:3025-3027 + §68:3044-3050 | Step A (T8), and all of Steps C-G | **SATISFIED** — owner attestation via explicit instruction "按你推荐的做": 154 constitutes a dedicated/non-shared host in the §65 sense (§68:3113-3115; satisfies R-W16 F1 and the W13 ISOLATED_HOST premise) |
| 0.2 | Step A executed: T8 qualification PASS on the final tree | §65 prerequisite 3 (DELIVERY_PLAN.md:2794); evidence in §2 below | Step B | **SATISFIED** — T8 EXECUTED AND PASSED at tree/commit 2e5cd30a on 154: 11 passed/0 failed; CLAUDE_RELAY_QUALIFICATION JSON with activation_authorized:false, relay_evidence.code=relay_refused_method with derived=false, dns_resolutions=0, upstream_connections=0, requests_refused=1, cgroup_survivors=[], launch digests = L9.1 values (15afa87d…/22a396e3…), port_window=[20000,32767], credentials=dummy-synthetic, fake service matches=true with zero connections (§68:3116-3125) |
| 0.3 | D-2: activation record PINNED and approved (status flips `blocked` → `approved-not-yet-effective` → `effective` only via the explicit decision) | Native-subagent arbitration (fresh, read-only, VERDICT line) + owner confirmation; template rule: approval flips no flag by itself (research-dispatch.md:646-648, 797-799) | Steps C-G | **OPEN** — the record draft is now PINNED with all available evidence (readiness pack §3, N5 update); remaining PENDING fields are exactly D-4 + the final owner go/no-go; the approval decision itself is outstanding |
| 0.4 | D-4: credential-supply procedure approved with an execution window inside the record's `valid_window_utc` | research-local-agent.md:1513-1551 is the designed procedure; approval is owner-gated and preconditioned on D-1 | Step F | **OPEN — HELD at the credential boundary** (§68:3137-3139: the final go/no-go and the credential-supply window require the owner's explicit statement before the fully pinned record). Operative only after explicit owner authorization; Step F boundary language below unchanged |
| 0.5 | CI "Offline verification" green at the pinned commit; no unresolved release-blocking review finding | §62/§68 conventions (latest green: run 37955091414 at d3eec34f, §68:3021) | Steps C-G | Standing at the pinned commit when D-2 re-pins; D-tuple prerequisite evidence satisfied by the N2-S6 distributed run (1 passed, kit provenance 67cad027) and CI linux-kit green (§62:2447, cited §68:3131-3132) |

No-rerun rule (§5:131-132): do NOT re-run checks that already
passed unaffected — the L9.1 verification chain (binding T1 re-run 12/12,
§65 five-file native block 322/1, `verify_local --full` PASS, CI green;
§68:3017-3023) stands as pinned evidence for tree d3eec34f, and the T8
qualification (11 过/0 败, §68:3116-3125) stands as pinned evidence for
tree 2e5cd30a. Commits from 2e5cd30a through e76361d7 touch
DELIVERY_PLAN.md only (verified `git diff --stat`: 1 file, +30 lines), so
no code surface moved; per the rule, the record re-pins at Step B and any
re-run decision follows the re-pinned commit or an affected-surface
change.

## 1. Stop conditions and global boundaries

- STOP on any first failure: capture the full first output separately,
  preserve it, and route to a fresh read-only review — never rerun-to-green
  silently (§68 conventions; l7-l8-status.md evidence rules).
- STOP if the host, bwrap provenance, interpreter or image digest diverges
  from the record pins (the T1 C4 divergence discipline, §68:2989-2991).
- STOP if any D- decision is partially satisfied or verbal: decisions must
  be recorded artifacts, not implications (§6:155-156).
- Replay discipline: the same task replayed returns the original result and
  never appends provider calls (§65:2798-2799 via §61:2300-2301; §53:1626).
  No automatic retry, no identity substitution, no Codex fallback
  (§53:1624-1625).
- Unknown billing stays unknown; never recorded as zero and never faked as
  a cap (§61:2301; §5 WP-02 stop conditions).
- Disposable per-test/qualification PG clusters only; the real project
  cluster is touched only by the parent-side managed session in Step F.

## 2. Step A — T8 qualification (§65 prerequisite 3; EXECUTED AND PASSED 2026-10-10)

**Executed outcome (recorded at e76361d7, §68:3116-3125):** T8 ran at
tree/commit `2e5cd30a70f81374c4302ba08592e1495337873b` (2e5cd30a) on 154
under the full opt-in matrix including
`POLYMARKET_ALPHA_LAB_CLAUDE_PROBE_ISOLATED_HOST=1` (the D-1 attestation,
§68:3113-3117), with the image re-acquired through the npm official
channel — sha256 5c47…47ab / 234,119,480 B, byte-identical to the L7 pin
(§68:3116-3118). Result: **11 passed / 0 failed** ("11 过/0 败"). Stdout
carried the CLAUDE_RELAY_QUALIFICATION JSON: activation_authorized:false;
relay_evidence.code=relay_refused_method with **derived=false**;
dns_resolutions=0; upstream_connections=0; requests_refused=1;
cgroup_survivors=[]; launch digests = the L9.1 values (15afa87d…/22a396e3…);
port_window=[20000,32767]; credentials=dummy-synthetic; fake service
matches=true with zero connections — the relay refused the
non-approved-method request at the protocol layer, which is one of the two
designed closed outcomes (gate rule, tests/test_research_claude_relay_
native.py:704-716). The JSON line and counts are pinned in the activation
record's `engineering_prerequisites.contained_qualification` field
(readiness pack §3). T8 authorizes nothing (gate file header,
tests/test_research_claude_relay_native.py:1-21); the earlier "blocked
pending D-1" state (§68:3024-3042 at 67cad027) is discharged history.

The rest of this section is retained as the reproduction/re-verification
record. It uses a FAKE Messages TLS service and a DUMMY synthetic key —
never a real endpoint (gate file header,
tests/test_research_claude_relay_native.py:1-21).

Preconditions (both now satisfied): D-1 resolved (0.1 — owner attestation
§68:3113-3115); the D-1 attestation is what licenses setting
`POLYMARKET_ALPHA_LAB_CLAUDE_PROBE_ISOLATED_HOST=1` — that flag is one of
the five mandatory probe variables (tests/claude_cli_probe.py:125-126) and
its value `1` is validated as part of the image opt-in
(tests/claude_cli_probe.py:146-157); setting it on a non-dedicated host
would be a false attestation — forbidden (W13 STOP rule, restated by plan
Revision 1 F1).

Command shape (verified against the gate file at 67cad027; the §68 record
confirms the executed run used this opt-in matrix and image identity at
2e5cd30a — §68:3116-3118 — without itemizing the pytest invocation; env
names at
tests/test_research_claude_relay_native.py:61-64; every missing
prerequisite after the relay opt-in is a FAILURE, never a skip —
test_research_claude_relay_native.py:106-163):

```bash
cd <repo-on-runtime-host>            # the D-1-attested host
set -euo pipefail
export PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTHONUTF8=1

```

Executed outcome (§68:3116-3125, quoted above): **11 passed / 0 failed**
plus the stdout line `CLAUDE_RELAY_QUALIFICATION {...}` with
`activation_authorized: false` inside. The N1-era single-test expectation
"1 passed" was the single-node selection shape; the executed run's count
as recorded by the ledger is 11 过/0 败 (§68:3118) — the ledger does not
itemize the collection, and none is invented here (gate rule at tests/
test_research_claude_relay_native.py:750-764). The realized closed outcome
was the preflight-blocker branch: success with NON-derived relay evidence
— the gate asserts evidence.get('derived') is False — and the relay's
protocol-layer refusal, both honest results. The JSON line and counts are
pinned in the activation record's
`engineering_prerequisites.contained_qualification` field (readiness pack
§3), and the qualification's evidence provisionally sets decision D-3:
the CLI's request refused at the relay protocol layer (fake service zero
connections) → the first real run's preflight set maintains the
L7-approved form (single HEAD /api/hello), no new endpoint authorized
(§68:3134-3136; readiness pack §2).

## 3. Step B — pin the activation record (D-2)

T8 evidence is IN HAND and already pinned into the draft record (readiness
pack §3, N5 update: `contained_qualification` cites the executed T8 run;
runtime_isolation carries the D-1 attestation; preflight_set carries the
provisional D-3 set). Remaining before submission: re-measure every still-
`MEASURED AT PINNING` field of the record on the exact host and tree of
the intended run; set `valid_window_utc` to cover the whole run (requires
the D-4 window statement + final owner go/no-go, §68:3137-3139); submit
the completed record through the §66 native-subagent arbitration (fresh,
read-only, VERDICT line) with owner confirmation. The record's
`status` stays `blocked` until the explicit approval decision, and approval
alone still does not flip `activation_authorized` — the effective-activation
decision is recorded with the record (research-dispatch.md:788-799). Only a
record with `status: effective` (or `approved-not-yet-effective` inside its
window, per the deciding authority's wording) opens Step C.

## 4. Step C — runtime host assembly and re-verification (execution conveniences re-measured, not trusted)

On the D-1-attested host (ubuntu@154.89.153.24 — Ubuntu 24.04.1,
kernel 6.8, 16 cores, 31 GiB; dedicated/non-shared in the §65 sense per
the owner's 2026-10-10 attestation, §68:3113-3115):

1. Repo pinned to the record's `commit_sha`, clean worktree, ff-only sync
   (W13 Step 0.2 idiom):
   ```bash
   git -C <repo> fetch origin && git -C <repo> status --short --branch
   git -C <repo> checkout main && git -C <repo> merge --ff-only origin/main
   git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD   # must equal the pinned commit_sha
   ```
2. Venv interpreter check (verify_local.py refuses non-venv interpreters,
   scripts/verify_local.py:131-134): `.venv/bin/python --version` — the
   version found is the one pinned in the record (on 154 the recorded value
   is system CPython 3.12.3, now a recorded environmental fact with floors
   via the adopted D-tuple hybrid re-pin — Python ≥3.11; kernel/namespace
   closure per the T1 empirical convention; §68:3126-3133, superseding the
   §68:2981-2983 "deviation" wording).
3. bwrap provenance: `command -v bwrap && bwrap --version` — expect exactly
   `bubblewrap 0.11.1`; provenance against the official tarball sha256
   `c1b7455a1283b1295879a46d5f001dfd088c0bb0f238abb5e128b3583a246f71`
   (§68:2984-2985). Record the binary's own sha256 for the record's
   `wrapper` pin.
4. PG18 runtime prefix discovery (runtime gate accepts a prefix whose
   `bin/{postgres,initdb,pg_ctl,psql,pg_controldata}` report one supported
   major 16/17/18 and which has `share/postgres.bki`,
   src/polymarket_alpha_lab/project_postgres/runtime.py): discover and
   measure; PG18 for fidelity (the W15-relayed 154 prefix is a pointer, not
   evidence — re-verify).
5. Delegated cgroup v2 subtree: a root carrying `cgroup.controllers` with
   `memory` and `pids`, fresh per run (W13 Step 0.6 idiom); the trusted
   parent must already sit inside the delegated subtree (§68 production
   insight, 68:2943-2945).
6. Disk headroom (§62-scale suites needed a few GiB; the real run itself is
   minutes-scale).

## 5. Step D — trust configuration and profile assembly (Python-level; the reviewed recipe)

This is the typed assembly proven by the §54 native composition
(tests/test_project_postgres_uncapped_audit_native.py:347-465) and the W3
relay-launch recipe (tests/test_research_process_linux.py:2380-2430),
composed for the real trust configuration. It runs on the runtime host
inside the operator's assembly script (NOT a new CLI — §53's fixed
three-file scope discipline; the composition point stays
`run_claude_research_rotation`).

1. **Trust configuration** (all values reviewed into the record at Step B;
   nothing discovered at run time — RelayTrustConfig construction is inert
   and declaration-only, src/polymarket_alpha_lab/research_linux_relay.py:
   1890-1914):
   - CA bundle: the reviewed real root set, pinned by absolute path +
     sha256 + exact byte size (`RelayCaBundlePin`, research_linux_relay.py:
     1875-1887; size cap 1 MiB, research_linux_relay.py:66).
   - Defaults landed unless the record says otherwise: hostname
     `api.anthropic.com` (research_linux_relay.py:41), scheme https, port
     443, TLS floor tls12, permitted-address rule
     `public-global-unicast-only`, the byte/time limits of
     research_linux_relay.py:57-69, request set = exactly one Messages
     POST, `preflight_entries=()` (empty by the deliberate blocker,
     research-local-agent.md:1439-1465). D-3 update (§68:3134-3136): the
     first real run's preflight set is PROVISIONALLY the L7-approved
     single HEAD /api/hello; the reviewed record (Step B output) carries
     that set, and enforcement — populating `preflight_entries` with
     exactly that reviewed entry — happens here at assembly per the
     approved record; the landed relay default stays one Messages POST
     with no preflight entries until that reviewed assembly
     (research_linux_relay.py:1913-1914). No new endpoint is authorized
     by the provisional set.
2. **Launch spec** (`LinuxLaunchSpec` with `egress_policy=EGRESS_RELAY` =
   `'relay-fixed-origin'` and `relay_trust=<the config above>`; the closed
   two-value egress branch and the typed-trust requirement are enforced at
   admission — src/polymarket_alpha_lab/research_process_linux.py:74-91,
   src/polymarket_alpha_lab/research_claude_operator.py:104-111). Measured
   inputs per the W3 recipe (tests/test_research_process_linux.py:
   2400-2419): wrapper pin (path/sha256/size), helper digest, interpreter
   pin, `discover_runtime_closure` output, vendor guest path, expected
   version output `2.1.278 (Claude Code)\n` (CLAUDE_VERSION,
   research_claude_exec.py:23), fresh delegated cgroup root, memory/pids/
   scratch caps from the record.
3. **Process spec + profile** (vendor identity in argv[0] + sha; §62 L5
   semantics, DELIVERY_PLAN.md:2397-2409): `ResearchProcessSpec` with the
   official image as the vendor, the environment allowlist carrying
   `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` = the symbolic relay endpoint
   `http://127.0.0.1:0` (RELAY_SYMBOLIC_ENDPOINT,
   research_process_linux.py:91 — substituted with the per-call drawn port
   from the reviewed [20000, 32767] window), bounded timeouts/caps per the
   record; `ClaudeExecProfile(process=spec, linux_launch=launch)` with the
   v3 relay branch selected by the closed egress value.
4. Record the profile's `contract_sha256` and computed v3 digest into the
   record's `profile` field.

## 6. Step E — reviewed input assembly (WP-01 flow; two single-request batches)

1. Real candidate discovery/preview through the existing WP-01 entries
   (e.g. `scripts/discover_crypto_research.py` — "Discover BTC/ETH
   candidates; optionally preview inputs. Never a model or DB run." — and
   the docs under docs/research-crypto-*.md). One candidate per team
   (`crypto_btc`, `crypto_eth`) passing the existing contract/observation
   gates; unsupported rules or already-observed events never start research
   (§5 WP-01 stop conditions).
2. Operator review and approval of the exact request bytes per the existing
   preview flow; the prepared request's `model_id` must equal the profile's
   (binding enforced at assembly, research_claude_operator.py:134-138).
   Proven shape: `preview.request(approved_terms_sha256=…)` (recipe:
   tests/test_project_postgres_dispatch_native.py:37-45).
3. Two immutable single-request `ResearchBatch` objects, one per team, with
   distinct `batch_id`s (research_claude_operator.py:130-133).
4. The typed authorization binding the exact reviewed roster in reviewed
   order and the profile contract (recipe:
   tests/test_project_postgres_uncapped_native.py:34-41; binding enforced
   at research_claude_operator.py:143-149), with the record's
   `valid_window_utc` covering `approved_at`/`expires_at`.

## 7. Step F — session, credential boundary, and the one audited rotation

1. **Session**: the operator owns an already-open project-private research
   session (managed `ProjectPostgres`; every DSN through
   `validate_local_postgres_dsn`; §53's "授权创建及回执核对 → 顺序入库两个
   批次" order — authorization creation and receipt verification FIRST, then
   sequential batch intake).
2. **Credential boundary (D-4)**: the operator types each team's key ONCE
   through the private local channel on the dedicated principal into the
   explicit in-memory slots of `FiniteInMemoryApiKeySupplier` — construction
   requires the rotation stop token by identity; one shared lock covers both
   teams; admission is lock → stop check → permanent consume
   (research-local-agent.md:1525-1534; src/polymarket_alpha_lab/
   research_claude_profile.py:248). One slot per team. The key never enters
   the profile digest, the activation record, audit rows, relay logs, tests
   or handoffs. Delivery to the contained client happens only after the
   durable call-start audit commits and model-phase readiness, via the
   existing one-use anonymous pipe (L5 semantics, §62:2404-2407). **This
   runbook stops here at the boundary; the channel mechanics are the
   reviewed procedure's own text, not repeated here.**
3. **The rotation** — the single composition point (§53:1622-1625):
   ```python
   operator.run_claude_research_rotation(
       session,
       reviewed_batches=(btc_batch, eth_batch),
       profile=profile,                      # Step D output
       authorization=permission,             # Step E output
       api_key_supplier=supplier,            # Step F.2 output
       rotation_id=<recorded id>, turn_id=<recorded id>,
       stop=control,                         # SAME object as supplier binding
       max_tasks=2, max_workers=2,           # the reviewed first-run shape
   )                                         # (research_claude_operator.py:156-159)
   ```
   The same stored authorization object and the same stop token reach the
   factory and the runner (`claude_profile_factory` inert opt-in binding,
   research_claude_profile.py:307-313; §54-native identity assertions,
   tests/test_project_postgres_uncapped_audit_native.py:467-476). No
   `model_budget_id` is passed (uncapped-by-review semantics; §53:1624-1625).
   Stop is cooperative: after any stop, failure or interruption, preserve
   original IDs and inspect durable state; never retry or replace
   identities (research_claude_operator.py:191-196).
4. **Observation duty**: the operator (or an observer wrapper of the §54
   pass-through shape) records the rotation report and per-call evidence
   without altering it; the relay's only evidence is fixed outcome codes
   and byte/counter metadata (research-local-agent.md:1358-1362).

## 8. Step G — evidence capture and G2 real-half acceptance reconciliation

1. Capture: exact commands, outputs, first failures, retries, skipped and
   unexecuted steps — into the activation record's `evidence.commands_
   results` field; preserve originals/incomplete/failures (§61:2300-2301).
2. Reconciliation (the §61 G2 wording): per team, at least one reviewed
   real execution with (a) the authorization/identity/usage rows joinable
   per record (call-start/outcome/reply fingerprints — the §54-native
   per-record audit join), (b) the served identity matching the pinned
   CLI/model, (c) replay proven not to append provider calls, (d) unknown
   billing recorded as unknown.
3. Ledger: the coordinator appends the run record to DELIVERY_PLAN.md per
   the §57 single-writer rule; the G2 real-research half closes only on
   that recorded evidence (§63:2743-2751 keeps only the synthetic-probe
   subcondition closed today).
4. Post-run: a fresh read-only review of the run evidence (Project Iron
   Rule 4) before any G2/G3 statement; the G3 final combination that
   depends on it stays a separate authorized step (§61:2303-2305).

## 9. Command provenance (parse-only validation, §22/§58 precedent)

Per the §22 precedent (guide examples verified against the real parsers
without executing write/network actions), every command shape, environment
variable, test name, API signature and file:line cited above was verified
by READING the landed files at 67cad027 — nothing was executed. Table of
the load-bearing verifications:

Known non-verifications (honesty): the `<repo-on-runtime-host>`, `<measured
image path>`, `${PG18_PREFIX}` and `${CGROUP_ROOT}` placeholders are
deliberately unbound — they are measured on the runtime host at execution
time per §4; the `effort` value of the CLI invocation is not carried by any
landed profile surface and is left to the record (flagged in the readiness
pack §3); no shell command in this runbook was executed during authoring —
neither at N1 authoring nor at the N5 update: the executed T8 values quoted
in §2 are the LEDGER record at §68:3116-3125, not a re-execution by N5.

## 10. Labeled self-review (N1 implementer)

- Draft labeling: the header and Step 0 state the operative-only-after-
  authorization status; no step self-authorizes; activation_authorized
  appears only as false.
- Ordering fidelity: the gate chain (D-1 → T8 → D-2 → D-4 → run) matches
  §65's prerequisite list and the plan's sequencing (§4: "the pivotal gate
  is the activation decision"); T8's blocked state is stated before its
  command shape.
- Boundary compliance: no credential material; the supply step stops at the
  reviewed procedure's boundary; Phase 1 paper-only/report-only/readonly
  restated; PostgreSQL-only persistence; no order/execution paths; no new
  layer or CLI introduced (assembly stays inside the existing typed module
  surface).
- Provenance: every command shape traced to landed files (§9 table);
  W12/W15 facts appear only as re-verify pointers; no invented flags,
  digests, counts or URLs.
- No-rerun discipline: Step 0 pins the standing L9.1 evidence instead of
  re-running it; re-runs are conditioned on tree movement or affected
  surfaces.
- Known limits: (a) Step E's discovery/preview sub-steps reference the
  existing WP-01 entries by name and doc rather than enumerating flags —
  enumerating them would exceed verified territory; (b) the observer
  wrapper in Step F.4 is described at the §54 shape level only; (c) if the
  D-1 ruling names a host other than 154, Steps C-D host facts re-measure
  wholesale — the shapes hold.

### N5 update self-review (2026-10-10 — SELF-REVIEW, labeled; not the independent review gate)

- Scope: only the two N5-assigned files touched (this runbook + the
  readiness pack); no command executed; not committed — coordinator gates
  and a fresh read-only review subagent (Project Iron Rule 4) remain.
- Gate-table fidelity: 0.1 (D-1) and 0.2 (T8) marked SATISFIED strictly
  from §68:3113-3125; 0.3 (D-2) OPEN with the record now evidence-pinned;
  0.4 (D-4) OPEN/HELD with §68:3137-3139 and the Step F boundary language
  UNCHANGED — operative only after explicit owner authorization; 0.5 keeps
  the pinned-commit CI rule and adds the D-tuple prerequisite citations
  (§68:3131-3132) without claiming a new CI run id.
- Step A: the executed outcome block quotes §68 verbatim (tree/commit
  2e5cd30a, opt-in matrix incl. ISOLATED_HOST=1, npm-channel image
  re-acquisition 5c47…47ab/234,119,480 B, 11 过/0 败, the JSON fields);
  the command shape is retained as reproduction record; the single-test
  "1 passed" expectation is reconciled against the ledger's 11/0 without
  inventing a collection explanation.
- D-3: Step A's D-3 sentence and Step D.1's request-set bullet updated to
  the provisional L7-approved single HEAD /api/hello set (§68:3134-3136);
  no new endpoint authorized; enforcement tied to the reviewed record at
  assembly; the landed relay default stated unchanged.
- Boundary compliance: no credential material added; Phase 1
  paper-only/report-only/readonly restated in the unchanged header;
  `activation_authorized` appears only as false; the runbook remains a
  draft — nothing operative.
- Known limits: the 15afa87d… launch digest is quoted only in its
  §68-abbreviated form; commits after 2e5cd30a through e76361d7 are
  documentation-only (verified `git diff --stat`), and the record re-pin
  rule at Step B governs any re-run question.
