# Phase 1 Module Index

Date: 2026-07-12
Status: documentation index for current Phase 1 added capabilities
Scope: docs-only index node

## Purpose

This index maps the current Phase 1 module surface to the tests that document
and protect each capability area. It is an operator and reviewer navigation
aid. It does not authorize source changes, database migrations, CLI behavior
changes, Supabase changes, execution/auth work, or live-trading work.

Phase 1 remains paper-only, report-only, and readonly. The modules listed here
may assemble research evidence, score paper/report readiness, format operator
packets, and expose local persistence/readback boundaries where already
implemented. They must not read accounts, handle credentials, sign orders,
submit orders, cancel orders, replace orders, route orders, mutate exchange
state, or convert paper evidence into automated live execution.

Durable project persistence remains local Supabase/Postgres only. Any module
with durable DB read/write behavior must preserve the local Supabase principle:
raw DSNs are validated through `validate_local_postgres_dsn`, local Supabase is
the only approved durable project-data target, and legacy file-backed surfaces
remain compatibility, export, replay, or read-only input boundaries unless a
reviewed migration explicitly moves them to local Supabase/Postgres.

## Market Discovery

Market discovery modules identify candidate markets and event context for
research triage. They are research intake surfaces only; discovery output is
not a trade recommendation, order intent, or execution queue.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/market_discovery_candidate_pool.py` | `tests/test_market_discovery_candidate_pool.py` | Builds a normalized candidate pool for market research and screening. |

## Forecast Context

Forecast context modules validate whether supplied market evidence, forecast
inputs, and confidence metadata are ready for paper/report review. They do not
size positions, approve execution, or fetch authenticated account state.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/market_forecast_source_recency_consensus_digest.py` | `tests/test_market_forecast_source_recency_consensus_digest.py` | Combines source recency and forecast consensus diagnostics. |

## Source Coverage

Source coverage modules make evidence completeness auditable before a candidate
can move into cost, risk, or manual review. Missing sources and weak source
classes create research gaps, not execution instructions.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |

| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/source_scraping_tool_coverage_readiness_report.py` | `tests/test_source_scraping_tool_coverage_readiness_report.py` | Reports public-source tool coverage and manual research gaps. |

## Freshness SLA

Freshness SLA modules expose stale market, source, outcome, and settlement
evidence before operator review. Freshness failures should route to refresh,
watch, research, or block status; they must not trigger live exchange mutation.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |

| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/market_candidate_information_freshness_score_report.py` | `tests/test_market_candidate_information_freshness_score_report.py` | Scores candidate information freshness for review. |

## Cost, EV, And Kelly

Cost, EV, and Kelly modules keep edge analysis side-aware and cost-aware for
paper/report use. In Phase 1, Kelly-style sizing output is a diagnostic or
position-sizing report surface only; it is not capital allocation, live order
sizing, or execution authorization.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |

## Portfolio Risk

Portfolio risk modules describe paper exposure, concentration, dependency, and
settlement/cash-drag pressure. They can throttle paper/report promotion or
raise operator review needs, but they do not manage live portfolios or mutate
accounts.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/candidate_portfolio_exposure_throttle.py` | `tests/test_candidate_portfolio_exposure_throttle.py` | Throttles candidate promotion based on paper exposure pressure. |

## Team Routing

Team routing modules assign research responsibility and specialist context.
Teams own research, forecasts, evidence, memory notes, and diagnostics only.
The central layer continues to own cost, risk, recommendation reducers, paper
allocation evidence, outcomes, and comparable reporting.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |

## Manual Go/No-Go

Manual go/no-go modules assemble operator-facing packets and safety checks.
They support human review and attestation. They must not submit, sign, cancel,
replace, route, or otherwise mutate orders.

## Post-Settlement Calibration

Post-settlement calibration modules turn settled outcomes into team and
strategy learning evidence. They can update report-only queues and calibration
evidence surfaces, but memory remains research context and must not tune live
strategy weights, size positions, rank investments, or authorize execution.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Report Discovery

Report discovery modules make report surfaces easier to locate and verify.
They are navigation and metadata helpers; they do not execute reports, mutate
databases, change CLI behavior, or repair missing upstream evidence.

| Module | Test | Phase 1 role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/report_discovery.py` | `tests/test_cli_report_discovery.py` | Discovers registered report surfaces for operator and CLI navigation. |

| `src/polymarket_alpha_lab/supabase_local_dsn.py` | `tests/test_supabase_local_dsn.py` | Validates the local Supabase/Postgres-only DSN boundary. |

## Boundary Checklist

Every listed capability should preserve these Phase 1 constraints:

- `paper_only=True`, `report_only=True`, and `readonly=True` where those hard
  flags exist.
- No live trading, account authentication, wallet handling, private-key
  handling, hosted account reads, order signing, order submission, order
  cancellation, order replacement, or exchange/order mutation paths.
- Cost, EV, Kelly, liquidity, settlement, and exposure outputs are paper/report
  diagnostics, not live capital allocation or order sizing.
- Team routing and team memory provide research responsibility and context
  only; central modules remain responsible for cost, risk, paper allocation
  evidence, outcomes, and comparable reporting.
- Durable project data persists to local Supabase/Postgres only; no new
  alternate database backend or file-backed durable substitute is introduced.
- Legacy JSONL/file-backed surfaces stay frozen as compatibility, export,
  replay, or read-only input boundaries unless separately migrated through a
  reviewed local Supabase/Postgres node.
